            <h2 class="section-title">About Youth Advocates Network</h2>
            <div class="about-grid">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Youth Advocates Network (YAN) is a network established in 2020 by youth-led and youth-serving organizations. The network strives to empower and amplify youth voices and initiatives so they can meaningfully participate in decision‑making spaces.</p>
                    <p>According to its founding narrative, YAN emerged after a training offered by UNICEF Rwanda, the “Youth Advocacy Guide (YAG)”, which brought together young leaders across Rwanda. Through that training, participants gained advocacy skills, communication and stakeholder engagement know‑how, and a broader network of peers and mentors.</p>
                    <p>The Network is anchored on a philosophy that youth have gold in them and the power to decide their life locus and champion change for a better world free from any form of discrimination, harassment, and violence, and that embraces diversity.</p>
                    <h3>Strategic Orientation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strengthening youth voice and agency in societal issues.</li>
                        <li>Promoting solidarity and collaboration among youth‑led organizations.</li>
                        <li>Facilitating capacity building, advocacy, and community‑level impact through collective action.</li>
                        <li>Encouraging sustainable, youth‑driven development and social behavior change across sectors.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Context &amp; Rationale</h3>
                    <p>Rwanda, like many African countries, has a vibrant but fragmented ecosystem of youth‑led organizations (covering health, education, social justice, climate, inclusion, etc.). However, these organizations often face structural limitations: lack of formal capacity in project design and management, inadequate financial and administrative skills, weak governance, and insufficient tools for sustainability.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, given the complexity of issues (nutrition, health, mental health, social behavior, inclusion, rights) and the unpredictability of funding or external support, many youth‑led organizations remain vulnerable, especially in times of resource scarcity, political shifts, or increased demand.</p>
