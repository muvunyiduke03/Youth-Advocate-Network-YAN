        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Independent youth advocates play a critical role in shaping Rwanda’s future, especially
          as over 78% of the population is under 35 (UNDP, 2021). These young leaders are not
          only addressing power imbalances and standing up for marginalized voices (Scottish
          Independent Advocacy Alliance, 2024), but they are also catalyzing economic recovery,
          social cohesion, and mental health awareness through grassroots action. As
          demonstrated by members of the Youth Advocate Network, their independent efforts—
          rooted in lived experience and driven by purpose—complement national development
          goals and highlight the transformative power of youth-led, rights-based advocacy in
          Rwanda’s post-pandemic landscape.
