        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Helping Heart Family Rwanda operates with a clear and unwavering mission: to
          promote and protect the rights of children in Rwanda in strict alignment with
          national and international human rights standards. Their vision is of a community
          where these rights are not just ideals but a lived reality for every child. Operating
          in Gasabo and Huye Districts, the organization focuses on key advocacy areas –
          education access, combating gender-based violence, legal rights awareness,
          mental health and substance abuse support, and youth empowerment – ensuring
          a holistic approach to child well-being.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          At the heart of Helping Heart Family Rwanda's mission is the fundamental right to education.
          The 'Tumurere Yize' (Let's Raise Them with Education) program champions this right for
          vulnerable children, including former street children, those from impoverished backgrounds,
          and children with disabilities. Through comprehensive educational support encompassing
          school fees, essential materials, and targeted assistance, the program ensures consistent
          attendance and fosters a genuine love for learning through the establishment of accessible
          libraries, nurturing literacy and academic growth.
