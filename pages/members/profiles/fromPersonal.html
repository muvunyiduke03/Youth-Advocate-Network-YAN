        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          25-year-old Cynthia Umutoni is
          turning her personal story of loss into
          powerful advocacy. Cynthia’s journey
          began with the discovery in her
          childhood that she herself was an
          orphan — raised by her grandmother
          after losing both parents as an infant.
          That realization reshaped her dream:
          not just to help orphans, but to
          become a voice for those who feel
          unseen, unloved, or forgotten.
          “I used to think I would become rich and raise
          orphans,” she shares,
          “but learning I was one of them gave that dream a deeper meaning.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Her work includes community outreach, public speaking, and
          school-based education, ensuring that adolescents have access to
          life skills, counseling, and safe spaces to speak up. Through her
          efforts, she’s empowered girls to leave sex work, educated youth
          on HIV prevention, and inspired young women to pursue new
          futures.
