        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hope for Tomorrow is a youth-led nonprofit working to
          break the barriers that keep rural girls
          from reaching their full potential, especially in education
          and reproductive health. The
          organization is based in Nyamasheke District, Rwanda,
          and provides scholarships, capacity
          building &amp; leadership development, and SRHR
          support to youth by establishing clubs in schools
          and organizing community sessions for out-of-school
          youth. These safe spaces equip youth with
          knowledge about Sexual and reproductive health, as well
          as leadership skills they need to thrive
          and reach their full potential.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since 2024 when Hope for
          Tomorrow started, it has returned to
          school 20 girls on full scholarships, created three SRH
          clubs in different schools, and reached
          over 300 adolescents through weekly GSRH sessions. The
          organization provides menstrual
          products to support girls to stay in school by reducing
          school absenteeism. In this line, we
          launched a menstrual cup pilot with young women,
          which is going to bring a sustainable solution
          to period poverty.
