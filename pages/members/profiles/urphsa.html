        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In Rwanda, a passionate group of future
          public health professionals is not
          waiting for tomorrow to make a
          difference. The University of Rwanda
          Public Health Students' Association
          (URPHSA), founded in 2017, is actively
          addressing community health
          challenges, bridging the gap between
          academic knowledge and real-world
          impact, and contributing to the
          achievement of key Sustainable
          Development Goals.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          URPHSA's aim is clear-to contribute
          meaningfully to the achievement of
          critical Sustainable Development Goals
          in Rwanda, encompassing poverty
          reduction, food security, health and
          well-being, clean water and sanitation, climate action, and environmental
          sustainability. Their mission is to nurture the next generation of public
          health professionals by equipping them with essential leadership,
          management, communication, and research skills, empowering them to
          tackle community health challenges effectively. URPHSA envisions itself as a
          leading student association that empowers the Rwandan public health
          workforce, fostering skilled and passionate professionals dedicated to
          equitably solving community health problems and creating a healthier, more
          equitable society.
