        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In the heart of Rwanda, Care and Help Child
          Organization, founded in 2018, stands as a beacon of
          hope for vulnerable children. Born from a single act of
          profound compassion, this organization is dedicated
          to breaking barriers to education, ensuring safety,
          fostering mental well-being, and empowering young
          minds to build brighter, more equitable futures.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Care and Help Child
          Organization's mission is clear
          and impactful: to break barriers
          to education, empower
          underprivileged children, and
          guide them toward brighter,
          more equitable futures. By
          forging strong partnerships with
          parents and communities, they
          strive to reach children who have
          dropped out of school, provide
          crucial support for continuous
          learning during vacations, and
          ensure that no child is left
          behind. Their advocacy goal is
          equally comprehensive,
          revolving around the holistic
          education of children,
          encompassing formal learning,
          the fundamental right to a life
          free from violence, and the
          nurturing of good mental health
          and sexual and reproductive
          health (SRH).
